description: Start a new feature development from user story
---

You are starting a new feature development. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the user story**: $ARGUMENTS
   - If a user story file path is provided, read it
   - If not provided, ask the user which user story to work on

2. **Launch the spec-writer agent** to create technical specification:
   - Read AGENTS.md to understand the project context
   - Create a detailed technical spec in `docs/specs/` directory
   - Name format: `SPEC-<US-ID>-<feature-name>.md`

3. **Present the spec** to the user for review before proceeding

4. **Ask user** if they want to continue with implementation or just create the spec

Remember: Always read the user story thoroughly before creating specs.
